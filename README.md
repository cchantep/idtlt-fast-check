**idonttrustlikethat-fast-check** is a plugin designed for [fast-check](https://fast-check.dev/). It convert [idonttrustlikethat](https://github.com/AlexGalays/idonttrustlikethat) validators to **fast-check** arbitraries. Allowing the possibility to use idtlt validators with fast-check.

## Installation

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install idonttrustlikethat-fast-check       # npm

yarn add idonttrustlikethat-fast-check          # yarn

bun add idonttrustlikethat-fast-check           # bun

pnpm add idonttrustlikethat-fast-check          # pnpm
```

## Basic usage

Creating a simple string fast-check arbitrary from a idtlt validator:

```typescript
import fc from 'fast-check';
import { string } from 'idonttrustlikethat';
import { inputOf } from 'idonttrustlikethat-fast-check';

const stringArbitrary = inputOf(string);

fc.assert(
  fc.property(stringArbitrary, (v) => {
    // Examples of generated values: "JT>\"C9k", "h]iD\"27;", "S", "n\\Ye", ""â€¦

    return string.validate(v).ok;
  }),
);
```

## Examples

Here's a basic example demonstrating the usage of `inputOf`:

```typescript
import fc from 'fast-check';
import { object, array, string, isoDate, boolean, union, literal } from 'idonttrustlikethat';
import { inputOf } from 'idonttrustlikethat-fast-check';

// Define a validator
const validator = array(
  object({
    id: string,
    article: array(
      object({
        id: string,
        author: string,
        created: isoDate,
        tag: union(literal('bunny'), literal('pony'), literal('fox')),
        content: string,
        published: boolean,
      }),
    ),
  }),
);

// Generate an arbitrary based on the validator
const arbitrary = inputOf(validator);

fc.assert(fc.property(arbitrary, (v) => validator.validate(v).ok));
```

In this example, arbitrary will be a randomly generated array that satisfies the specified validation rules.

## Warning
